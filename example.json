Kennedy School of Government. The medical school is affiliated with several teaching hospitals, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. For Harvard undergraduates, the most popular majors include social sciences, biology/biological sciences, history, math and psychology. The university’s academic calendar is semester-based and English is the language of instruction. Most undergraduate students live on campus for all four years, first residing around the Harvard Yard at the center of campus as freshmen and then in one of 12 undergraduate houses for the duration of their studies. Some university housing is available for graduate students. The Harvard Library is the largest academic library in the world, boasting around 19 million volumes at its more than 70 libraries."

The academic calendar is a 4-1-4 system with a four-week \"Independent Activities Period\" in January. During this period, undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff and alumni participate in forums, lecture series, recitals and other special activities. \n\n First-year undergraduate students are the only ones required to live on campus but many students further along in their studies choose to reside on campus as well. There are many opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to gain research experience at one of MIT’s many labs or centers, including the MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory, one of the largest university research reactors in the U.S. Nearly 90 percent of MIT undergraduates participate in the school’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, which partners students and faculty for research projects, by the time they graduate. More than $675 million was spent on research at MIT in a recent year, with additional federal funding going to MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, a Department of Defense research and development lab focused on technological solutions to national security issues."

Roughly 15 percent of the student body is international, and tuition and fees are higher for out-of-state students. Around 3,000 international scholars come to Berkeley each year in temporary teaching or research positions. Berkeley research is conducted not just within academic department labs and research centers but also in some of the school’s museums and university-managed biological field stations. Research in botany, zoology, ecosystems and forestry is undertaken at the remote field station sites. Berkeley researchers discovered several of the elements on the periodic table, including californium and berkelium."

Research at Oxford takes place in all four of its academic divisions: humanities; mathematical, physical and life sciences; medical sciences; and social sciences. Oxford’s academic calendar is divided into three terms – Michaelmas (fall), Hilary (spring) and Trinity (summer) – each eight weeks long. The language of instruction at the university is English.\n\n The University of Oxford is made up of a central university; 38 colleges; and six Permanent Private Halls, which tend to be smaller than colleges and offer fewer subjects. The colleges at Oxford are each equipped with a dining hall, common room and library. Undergraduates are guaranteed college housing for their freshman year and can often continue to live there during the later years of their studies. Graduate students are not guaranteed housing but some colleges may have space for them during their first year, especially for international students. Tuition costs are higher for non-European Union students. The university and its academic departments and colleges, as well as dozens of external organizations, have made more than 900 scholarships available for graduate students."

The school's oldest and largest campus in terms of enrollment is located in Seattle – the largest city in Washington. In 1990, the university added two smaller campuses in Bothell and Tacoma, Washington. Around 70 percent of the university's students – across all three campuses – study at the undergraduate level. Still, the large university offers more than 370 graduate-level programs. Tuition costs are higher for non-Washington-state residents, and university housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students. UW utilizes a quarter-based academic calendar, and English is the language of instruction. \n\nThe university has 16 colleges and schools that offer studies in a range of subjects, such as arts and sciences, engineering and social work. Its highly ranked graduate schools include the School of Medicine, School of Nursing and the College of Education. The University of Washington Medical Center, a teaching hospital, is highly ranked in several specialties. The university offers a community-based medical education program that allows students to complete clinical rotations in different states throughout the region - Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Washington and Wyoming. One goal of the program is to increase the number of primary care physicians, particularly in rural areas. Research awards received by UW have topped $1 billion in recent years, and the school has more than 280 specialized research centers. Among these research centers are the West Coast Poverty Center, the Polar Science Center and the Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases."

The science and engineering-focused school is located in Pasadena, California, roughly 11 miles northeast of Los Angeles. There are roughly 2,200 students at Caltech, with around 55 percent of them studying at the graduate level. The student-faculty ratio is very low, at 3:1. More than one-fourth of Caltech's total enrollment is international. The school’s academic calendar is based on the quarter system and English is the language of instruction.\n\n Caltech has six academic divisions, many of which have highly ranked graduate programs: biology and biological engineering; chemistry and chemical engineering; engineering and applied science; geology and planetary sciences; humanities and social sciences; and physics, mathematics and astronomy. The university guarantees housing for all first-year undergraduate and graduate students. Instead of typical undergraduate residence halls like those found at many U.S. universities, there are eight undergraduate houses, each with its own government and special traditions. Newly admitted graduate students are given priority for housing in the on-campus Catalina Apartments. \n\n Around 80 percent of undergraduates participate in research during their time at Caltech. The university offers a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships program where students write research proposals, collaborate with mentors and give presentations on their projects. Caltech has around 50 research institutes and centers, such as the Resnick Sustainability Institute and the Tectonics Observatory. Additionally, the university operates NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a center for robotic exploration of the solar system that engages both faculty and students."
